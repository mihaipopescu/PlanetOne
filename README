PlanetOne
---------


1. For every planet that I own
	For every planet that is not mine yet
		simulate who will own the planet at the end of the game
		If I will not be the owner of the planet, take action if possible
		Simulate who will own the planet at the end of the game

2. For every planet that is not mine
	Compute the best strategy to send a fleet from my best-closesest planet
	Send as much ships as needed to capture the planet ( + Growth to have 1 turn in advance)
	If I cannot send as much ships as needed, send some to sacrifice to weaken the planet
